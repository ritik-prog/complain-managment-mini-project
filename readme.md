### Introduction

Are you a college student looking to create a project that showcases your coding skills? Look no further than the Complain Management System project, available for free on GitHub. This project is written in both C# and VB.NET, making it a great choice for students who are comfortable working in either language.

### Prerequisites

Before we dive into the installation process, make sure you have the following tools and software installed on your computer:

* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/): This is the integrated development environment (IDE) used to build and run the project.
    
* [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework): This is a software framework developed by Microsoft that is necessary for running the project.
    

### Installation

Once you have these tools installed, follow these steps to install and run the Complain Management System project:

1. Download the project files from GitHub. You can find them at
    
    ```bash
    https://github.com/ritik-prog/complain-managment-system
    ```
    
    Click the green "**Code**" button and then select "**Download ZIP**" to download the project files to your computer.
    
2. Extract the project files to a folder on your computer. You can do this by right-clicking on the ZIP file and selecting "Extract All".
    
3. Open Visual Studio and select "Open a project or solution" from the home screen.
    
4. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the project files and select the file "Complain Management System.sln". This will open the project in Visual Studio.
    

### Setup Database

1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the "helphub.db" file in the Solution Explorer window and select "Properties".

2. In the Properties window, set the "Copy to Output Directory" property to "Copy always".

3. Save the changes and build your project.
    

By setting the "Copy to Output Directory" property, Visual Studio will automatically copy the "helphub.db" file to the bin folder every time you build your project. If this is not happening automatically, you can manually copy the file to the bin folder by following these steps:

1. Build your project by selecting "Build" from the menu bar and then selecting "Build Solution".
    
2. Once the build is complete, navigate to the bin folder in your project directory.
    
3. Locate the "helphub.db" file in your project directory and copy it.
    
4. Paste the file into the bin folder.
    
    1. Sure, I'll provide more information on the location of the bin folder in your Visual Basic project. The bin folder is a subdirectory within your project's root directory that contains the executable files and other resources that are generated when you build your project.
        
    2. By default, the bin folder is located within your project's directory structure. To access the bin folder, navigate to the root directory of your project, then open the "bin" folder. Inside the "bin" folder, you will see subfolders for each configuration of your project (such as Debug and Release). The "helphub.db" file will be copied to the appropriate subfolder based on the configuration you are building.
        
    3. For example, if you are building the Debug configuration of your project, the "helphub.db" file will be copied to the "Debug" subfolder within the bin folder. Similarly, if you are building the Release configuration, the file will be copied to the "Release" subfolder.
        
        I hope this provides more clarity on the location of the bin folder within your Visual Basic project!

That's it! By following these steps, you can ensure that the "helphub.db" file is always copied to the bin folder of your Visual Basic project.
